`Highcharts Stock <https://www.highcharts.com/products/stock/>`__ objects re-use many of
the same properties. This is one of the strengths of the Highcharts API, in that it is
internally consistent and that behavior configured on one object should be readily
transferrable to a second object provided it shares the same properties. However,
Highcharts Stock has a *lot* of properties. For example, I estimate that
the ``options.plotOptions`` objects and their sub-properties have close to 3,000
properties. But because they are heavily repeated, those 3,000 or so properties can be
reduced to only 421 unique property names. That's almost an 85% reduction.

:iabbr:`DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)` is an important principle in software development.
Can you imagine propagating changes in seven places (on average) in your code? That would
be a maintenance nightmare! And it is exactly the kind of maintenance nightmare that class
inheritance was designed to fix.

For that reason, the **Highcharts for Python Toolkit** classes have a deeply nested
inheritance structure. This is important to understand both for evaluating
:func:`isinstance() <python:isinstance>` checks in your code, or for understanding how to
further subclass Highcharts for Python components.

    the class inheritance diagrams included for each documented class.
