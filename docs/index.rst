Why Highcharts for Python?
*********************************

Odds are you are aware of `Highcharts JS <https://www.highcharts.com>`__. If not, why not?
It is the world's most popular, most powerful, category-defining JavaScript data
visualization library. If you are building a web or mobile app/dashboard that will be
visualizing data in some fashion, you should absolutely take a look at the Highcharts
suite of solutions. Just take a look at some of their fantastic
`demo visualizations <https://www.highcharts.com/demo>`_.

As the library name suggests, Highcharts JS is a JavaScript library. It is written in
JavaScript, and is specifically used to configure and render data visualizations in a
web browser (or other JavaScript-executing, like mobile app) environment. As a JavaScript
library, its audience is JavaScript developers. But what about the broader ecosystem of
Python developers and data scientists?

Python is increasingly used as the technology of choice for data scientists and for
creating the back-end of leading enterprise-grade applications. As such, it often provides
the backend services that drive web and mobile applications - in other words, Python is
often the backend that delivers data and content to the front-end...which then renders it
using JavaScript and HTML.

There are numerous Python frameworks (Django, Flask, Tornado, etc.) with specific
capabilities to simplify integration with Javascript frontend frameworks (React, Angular,
VueJS, etc.). But facilitating that with Highcharts has historically been very difficult.
Part of this difficulty is because Highcharts JS - while supporting JSON as a
serialization/deserialization format - leverages JavaScript object literals to expose the
full power and interactivity of its data visualizations. And while it's easy to serialize
JSON from Python, serializing and deserializing to/from JavaScript object literal notation
is much more complicated. This means that Python developers looking to integrate with
Highcharts typically had to either invest a lot of effort, or were only able to access
a small portion of Highcharts rich functionality.

So I wrote the **Highcharts for Python** toolkit to bridge that gap.

**Highcharts for Python** provides Python object representation for *all* of the
JavaScript objects defined in the Highcharts API. It provides automatic data validation,
and exposes simple and standardized methods for serializing those Python objects
back-and-forth to JavaScript object literal notation.

Key Highcharts for Python Features
======================================

* **Clean and consistent API**. No reliance on "hacky" code, :class:`dict <python:dict>`
  and JSON serialization, or impossible to maintain / copy-pasted "spaghetti code".
* **Comprehensive Highcharts support**. Every single Highcharts chart type and every
  single configuration option is supported in **Highcharts for Python**. This includes the
  use of Highcharts' rich JavaScript formatter (JS callback function) capabilities that
  are often needed to get the most out of Highcharts' visualization and interaction
  capabilities.
* **Simple JavaScript Code Generation**. With one method call, produce production-ready
  JavaScript code to render your interactive visualizations using Highcharts' rich
  capabilities.
* **Easy and Robust Chart Download**. With one method call, produce high-end static
  visualizations that can be downloaded or shared as files with your audience. Produce
  static charts using the Highsoft-provided
  :term:`Highcharts Export Server <Export Server>`, or using your own private export
  server as needed.
* **Integration with Pandas and PySpark**. With two lines of code, produce a high-end
  interactive visualization of your Pandas or PySpark dataframe.
* Leverage Highcharts visualization templates in your Python code to eliminate "fiddly"
  configuration tweaks.
* **Consistent code style**. For Python developers, switching between Pythonic code
  conventions and JavaScript code conventions can be...annoying. So
  **Highcharts for Python** applies Pythonic syntax with automatic conversion between
  Pythonic ``snake_case`` notation and JavaScript ``camelCase`` styles.

    my_chart.title = {
        'align': 'center'
        'floating': True,
        'text': 'The Title for My Chart',
        'use_html': False,
    }

    my_chart.credits = {
        'enabled': True,
        'href': 'https://www.highcharts.com/',
        'position': {
            'align': 'center',
