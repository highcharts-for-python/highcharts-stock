Why Highcharts for Python?
*********************************

`Highcharts <https://www.highcharts.com>`__ is the world's most popular, most powerful, 
category-defining JavaScript data visualization library. If you are building a web or 
mobile app/dashboard that will be visualizing data in some fashion, you should 
absolutely take a look at the Highcharts suite of solutions. Take a peak at some 
fantastic `demo visualizations <https://www.highcharts.com/demo>`__.

As a suite of JavaScript libraries, `Highcharts <https://www.highcharts.com>`__ is 
written in JavaScript, and is used to configure and render data visualizations in a
web browser (or other JavaScript-executing) environment. As a set of JavaScript
libraries, its audience is JavaScript developers. But what about the broader ecosystem of
Python developers and data scientists?

Given Python's increasing adoption as the technology of choice for data science and for
the backends of leading enterprise-grade applications, Python is often the backend that 
delivers data and content to the front-end...which then renders it using JavaScript and 
HTML.

There are numerous Python frameworks (Django, Flask, Tornado, etc.) with specific
capabilities to simplify integration with Javascript frontend frameworks (React, Angular,
VueJS, etc.). But facilitating that with Highcharts has historically been very difficult.
Part of this difficulty is because the Highcharts JavaScript suite - while supporting JSON as a
serialization/deserialization format - leverages JavaScript object literals to expose the
full power and interactivity of its data visualizations. And while it's easy to serialize
JSON from Python, serializing and deserializing to/from JavaScript object literal notation
is much more complicated. 

This means that Python developers looking to integrate with Highcharts typically had to 
either invest a lot of effort, or were only able to leverage a small portion of Highcharts' 
rich functionality.

So we wrote the **Highcharts for Python Toolkit** to bridge that gap.

**Highcharts for Python** provides Python object representation for *all* of the
JavaScript objects defined in the
`Highcharts (JavaScript) API <https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/>`__. It provides automatic 
data validation, and exposes simple and standardized methods for serializing those Python
objects back-and-forth to JavaScript object literal notation.

**Highcharts Stock for Python** in particular provides support for
the `Highcharts Stock <https://www.highcharts.com/products/stock/>`__ extension, which is
designed to provide rich time series data visualization capabilities optimized for
asset (e.g. stock) price data visualization, with extensive technical indicators and
robust interactivity. For ease of use, it also includes the full functionality of
`Highcharts Core for Python <https://core-docs.highchartspython.com>`__ as well.

Key Highcharts Stock for Python Features
==============================================

* **Clean and consistent API**. No reliance on "hacky" code, ``dict``
  and JSON serialization, or impossible to maintain / copy-pasted "spaghetti code".
* **Comprehensive Highcharts support**. Every single Highcharts chart type and every
  single configuration option is supported in **Highcharts Stock for Python**. This
  includes the over 70 data visualization types supported by
  `Highcharts Core <https://www.highcharts.com/product/highcharts/>`__,  the specialisted
  chart types and 50+ technical indicator visualizations available in
  `Highcharts Stock <https://www.highcharts.com/product/stock/>`__.
  
  Every Highcharts for Python library provides full support for the rich JavaScript 
  formatter (JS callback functions) capabilities that are often needed to get the most 
  out of Highcharts' visualization and interaction capabilities.

  .. seealso::

    * :doc:`Supported Visualizations <visualizations>`

* **Simple JavaScript Code Generation**. With one method call, produce production-ready
  JavaScript code to render your interactive visualizations using Highcharts' rich
  capabilities.
* **Easy Chart Download**. With one method call, produce high-end static
  visualizations that can be downloaded or shared as files with your audience. Produce
  static charts using the Highsoft-provided 
  :term:`Highcharts Export Server <Export Server>`, or using your own private export 
  server as needed.
* **Integration with Pandas and PySpark**. With two lines of code, produce a high-end
  interactive visualization of your Pandas or PySpark dataframe.
* **Consistent code style**. For Python developers, switching between Pythonic code
  conventions and JavaScript code conventions can be...annoying. So
  the Highcharts for Python toolkit applies Pythonic syntax with automatic conversion between
  Pythonic ``snake_case`` notation and JavaScript ``camelCase`` styles.

    # from a primitive array, using keyword arguments
    my_chart = Chart(data = [[1, 23], [2, 34], [3, 45]], 
                     series_type = 'line')

    # from a primitive array, using the .from_array() method
    my_chart = Chart.from_array([[1, 23], [2, 34], [3, 45]], 
                                series_type = 'line')

    # from a Numpy ndarray, using keyword arguments
    my_chart = Chart(data = numpy_array, series_type = 'line')

    # from a Numpy ndarray, using the .from_array() method

    # from a HighchartsOptions configuration object
    my_chart = Chart.from_options(my_options)

    # from a Series configuration, using keyword arguments
    my_chart = Chart(series = my_series)

    # from a Series configuration, using .from_series()
    my_chart = Chart.from_series(my_series)

3. Configure Global Settings (optional)
=============================================

  .. code-block:: python

    # Import SharedStockOptions
    from highcharts_stock.global_options.shared_options import SharedStockOptions

    # from a JavaScript file
    my_global_settings = SharedStockOptions.from_js_literal('my_js_literal.js')

    # from a JSON file
    my_global_settings = SharedStockOptions.from_json('my_json.json')

    # from a Python dict
    my_global_settings = SharedStockOptions.from_dict(my_dict_obj)

    # from a HighchartsOptions configuration object
    my_global_settings = SharedStockOptions.from_options(my_options)


4. Configure Your Chart / Global Settings
================================================

  .. code-block:: python

    from highcharts_stock.options.title import Title
    from highcharts_stock.options.credits import Credits

    # EXAMPLE 1.
    # Using dicts
    my_chart.title = {
        'align': 'center'
        'floating': True,
        'text': 'The Title for My Chart',
        'use_html': False,
    }

    my_chart.credits = {
        'enabled': True,
        'href': 'https://www.highchartspython.com/',
        'position': {
            'align': 'center',
            'vertical_align': 'bottom',
            'x': 123,
            'y': 456
        },
        'style': {
            'color': '#cccccc',
            'cursor': 'pointer',
            'font_size': '9px'
        },
        'text': 'Chris Modzelewski'
    }

    # EXAMPLE 2.
    # Using direct objects
    from highcharts_stock.options.title import Title
    from highcharts_stock.options.credits import Credits

    my_title = Title(text = 'The Title for My Chart',
                     floating = True, 
                     align = 'center')
    my_chart.options.title = my_title

    my_credits = Credits(text = 'Chris Modzelewski', 
                         enabled = True, 
                         href = 'https://www.highchartspython.com')
    my_chart.options.credits = my_credits


5. Generate the JavaScript Code for Your Chart
=================================================

Now having configured your chart in full, you can easily generate the JavaScript code
that will render the chart wherever it is you want it to go:

  .. code-block:: python

    # as a string
    js_as_str = my_chart.to_js_literal()

    # to a file (and as a string)
    js_as_str = my_chart.to_js_literal(filename = 'my_target_file.js')


6. Generate the JavaScript Code for Your Global Settings (optional)
=========================================================================

  .. code-block:: python

    # as a string
    global_settings_js = my_global_settings.to_js_literal()

    # to a file (and as a string)
    global_settings_js = my_global_settings.to_js_literal('my_target_file.js')


7. Generate a Static Version of Your Chart
==============================================

  .. code-block:: python

    # as in-memory bytes
    my_image_bytes = my_chart.download_chart(format = 'png')

    # to an image file (and as in-memory bytes)
    my_image_bytes = my_chart.download_chart(filename = 'my_target_file.png',
                                             format = 'png')

8. Render Your Chart in a Jupyter Notebook
===============================================

  .. code-block:: python

    my_chart.display()
