---------------------

Release 1.4.0
=========================================

* **MAJOR** performance gains in the ``.to_js_literal()`` method. Implementation seems to
  improve performance by 50 - 90%.
* *SIGNIFICANT* performance gains in the ``.to_json()`` method. Implementation seems to 
  improve performance by 30 - 90%.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Significantly simplified use of the ``.from_pandas()`` method to support:

  * creation of multiple series from one DataFrame in one method call
  * creation of series without needing to specify a full property map
  * support for creating series by DataFrame row, rather than just by DataFrame column

* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added the ``.from_pandas_in_rows()`` method to support creation of
  charts and series from simple two-dimensional DataFrames laid out in rows.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added one-shot chart creation and rendering from Series objects.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added one-shot chart creation using ``series`` and ``data``/``series_type`` keywords.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``.convert_to()`` convenience method to Series objects.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``CallbackFunction.from_python()`` method which converts a Python function
  to its JavaScript equivalent using generative AI, with support for both OpenAI and Anthropic.

  Jupyter Lab) and when saved to a static HTML file.

---------------------

Release 1.3.0
=========================================

* **ENHANCEMENT:** Modified the way that data points are serialized to JavaScript literal objects. Now, they are serialized to a JavaScript array if their configured properties are those that Highcharts (JS) supports in JavaScript array notation. Otherwise, the code falls back to serialize the data point as a JavaScript object literal. This change is intended to improve performance and reduce the size of the serialized data. (#27)
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``__repr__()`` method for Highcharts Core for Python classes.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``__str__()`` method with special handling for difficult-to-read classes.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``Chart.get_script_tags()`` to retrieve Javascript ``<script>`` tags.
* **ENHANCEMENT:** Added ``utility_functions.to_snake_case()`` function.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed incorrect serialization of datetime and Pandas ``Timestamp`` objects in ``.to_dict()`` and ``.to_json()``.
* **BUGFIX:** Fixed incorrect serialization of ``EnforcedNull`` in ``.to_dict()`` and ``.to_json()``.

-------------------

Release 1.2.1
=========================================

* **BUGFIX:** Fixed incorrect ``datetime`` serialization to SECONDS from Unix epoch. Now serializing to JS-compatible MILLISECONDS from Unix epoch.
